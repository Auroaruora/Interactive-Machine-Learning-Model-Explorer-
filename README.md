# Machine Learning Model Explorer

## Overview
This repository contains three main components for a project aimed at exploring and analyzing machine learning models using a labeled credit-card dataset.

### R Shiny App(Machine_Learning_Model_Explorer_Website): 
An interactive application for data upload, preprocessing, exploration, and model training. It supports various algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, and Neural Networks, allowing users to evaluate models with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

### R Code for Data Analysis(Supplementary_Material):
A set of R scripts used to analyze the credit-card labeled dataset from Kaggle. This folder contains all the preprocessing, exploration, and statistical analysis performed on the dataset.

### Analysis Report(Written_Report): 
A written report in LaTeX and PDF formats that documents the findings and methodology of the data analysis, including insights gained from the dataset and model performance.
